== Static Starter

This is a HAML/SASS enabled static site application for Ruby on Rails. Just add your pages and styles.

== Getting Started

1. Start your server and checkout the homepage.

2. Start editing your homepage at /app/views/pages/home.html.haml

3. To add new pages just create a new page inside /app/views/pages/
      Name your page whatever you want the url to be.
      ie. /app/views/pages/contact.html.haml will be at http://yoursite.com/contact

4. Customize your styles in /public/stylesheets/sass/styles.sass

== Further Customization

1. If you want to add special logic to certain pages you can create a new action in /app/controllers/pages_controller.rb
      For example, if you wanted to add dynamic contacts to the Contact page and have it use a special layout:
      (you'd need a Contact model and a contact.html.haml layout in /app/views/layouts for this to work)
      def contact
        @contacts = Contact.all
        render :template => "pages/contact", :layout => "contact"
      end

      Next, put this in your config/routes.rb, above the pages routing so that it uses your new contact action instead of the pages#show action:
      match 'contact' => 'pages#contact'
